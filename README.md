# Time Calculator (24 hour - format)

### Used for calculating time intervals within a span of 24 hours.

Here is a simple example:
```
Enter time below
==================
Starting  hour: 15
Starting minut: 23

Ending    hour: 21
Ending   minut: 56
Total time = 6h 33m
==================
Starting  hour: 17  
Starting minut: 45

Ending    hour: 03
Ending   minut: 14
Total time = 9h 29m
==================
```
Created as a little tool for my day job, my colleagues find it useful, since we are daily running a lot of time calculations.
